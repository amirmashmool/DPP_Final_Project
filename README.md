# Data Protection And Privacy Project
Maintaining Data Privacy in Association Rule Mining "Mask Algorithm" implementation with Python

## Getting started
To run the project is sufficient to clone or download this repository, with the command:
python -m notebook then run your notebook


## repo explanation
This paper discusses the challenge of obtaining accurate input data for data mining services while addressing privacy concerns. It explores whether users can be motivated to provide correct information by guaranteeing privacy protection during the mining process. proposing a scheme that distorts user data probabilistically, ensuring a high level of privacy while maintaining accurate mining results. It is this distorted information that is eventually supplied to the data miner, along with a description of the distortion procedure. The performance of the scheme is validated using real and synthetic datasets.
