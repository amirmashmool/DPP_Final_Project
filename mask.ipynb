    "This paper discusses the challenge of obtaining accurate input data for data mining services while addressing privacy concerns. It explores whether users can be motivated to provide correct information by guaranteeing privacy protection during the mining process. proposing a scheme that distorts user data probabilistically, ensuring a high level of privacy while maintaining accurate mining results. The performance of the scheme is validated using real and synthetic datasets."

    "The paper assumes a database model where each customer's data is represented as a tuple consisting of a fixed-length sequence of 1's and 0's. This model is commonly used for market-basket databases, where columns represent items sold by a supermarket, and each row represents a customer's purchases (1 indicating a purchase and 0 indicating no purchase).\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption is that the number of 1's (purchases) in the database is significantly smaller than the number of 0's (non-purchases) ==> In short, the database is modeled as a large disk-resident two-dimensional sparse boolean matrix."
